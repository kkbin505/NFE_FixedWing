/*NFE Notes
101022 Flight report - tested ACCELEROMETER_DRIFT_FIX define and removed it from defaults - performance in fixed wing angle w/this was much worse than drones.  Gravity vector system got confused very fast untill roll was
still being leveled but no longer responding to input.  I suspect the vector is losing its length again somehow like it did on drones for yaw?  Eventually roll input created
a sharp pitch up response.  Total nonsense.  Without this define it took multiple 15 minute flights of carving around in levelmode before i encountered one gravity vector issue
presenting on roll axis as a loss of stick response.  Last few days have been focused on getting a levelmode working better.  I think a rate based yaw may still be a good solution but it will 
need a workover for I term like sport mode.  Overall levelmode at this point is functional but something still feels kinda wrong.  It seems sometimes I can hit the full user defined
 bank angel and sometimes I cant as easily or at all.  Also pitch authority while roll is banked is close to non existant.  So a bank and yank turn still needs a huge flying space.  Addition of the 
sport mode based rudder brings around any turn in a small space but this sport mode yaw is not going to be suitable for kids/new pilots - it can do a flat spin in levelmode and 
that's just too much for the intention of levelmode.  The craft retains its level orientation without issue even with a full 3d yaw deflection - but stick banging yaw by a new pilot will cause a
sudden loss of altitude (think flat spin).  Otherwise levelmode is a home run especially for low speed 3d training- can harrier around all day without wing rock or loss of control 
Failsafe comes down in levelmode and if the pitch trim on the accelerometer is tweaked correctly - lands nicely.  Engaging level in all sorts of crazy orientations results in a predictable and gentle return to level orientation.
Lower gains in anglepid.c were tested today and I think I have discovered the lower limits and have butter smooth control - almost too disconnected and slow for emergency corrections
and many crashes were avoided by having sportmode yaw and using that yaw input to get out away from obstacles.
Today I turned back up the integral gain on pitch  - gusseting in a high speed knife edge was reduced and i didnt feel like i was fighting I gains too much when level as had so in the past - 
I think prior issues here were due to growing pains of getting unicorn rates all in sync as rx[] gets shifted, expo'd, and then shifted back.
The trim range of unicorn rates seems acceptable and allows for a pretty wide range of centered trim points without leaving the linear band and then causing a loss of trim when switching to low rates.
Last note from today - for the first time i seem to have realized my roll rate in sportacro is faster to one side than the other.  Was hard to evaluate and switching to manual mode
didnt provide any clear insight.  Seems like i feel it too in angle mode.  This could just be torque from the motor throwing me off, and i did have one aileron pushrod in the wrong hole.
Maybe this is all just physics, but i can't help but worry if something in the pid loop is pushing the wrong way to one side.  Elevator pid response also seems less than rudder and ailerons - 
and again here i can't rule out mechanical setup but it certainly seems the same as the other axis.  Maybe it's just my imagination

thoughts after today's session 
- racemode needs to be renamed to something more applicable to planes like DIGITAL_DIHEDRAL
- DIGITAL_DIHEDRAL could be a whole new flight mode as a sum of the levelmode and sportmode controls and might behave more like an actual dihedral wing
- a heading lock (i term) can be implimented in levelmodes for yaw but it is going to need to release on either yaw or roll input instead of just yaw
- need more pitch authority in levelmode while banked
- need to test slightly higher gains in anglepid.c
- need to examine the threshold for i-term relax (iwindup=2 state) - this is still tied to setpoint variable as is the D term's stick boost response.  When lower acro
	rates are configured by a user - i think this is causing I term to be too sticky (not triggering iwindup=2) and is reducing the affect of stick boost

101222 Flight Report - Testing levelmode, sportmode & failsafe.  The new bank&yank levelmode continues to produce exactly the indended results.  Flight feels very natural and predictable 
with only minor exceptions.  The I term on pitch is working it's tail off compensating for changes in airspeed with hands off sticks.  For normal fluid throttle changes - there is no 
visible correction and it always tracks true.  However going from the edge of stall @ no throttle to full throttle abruptly will briefly balloon up as the pitch I term has been previously loaded 
up in a trim up position and it takes a second for it to unwind itself.  I think the solution to this is to use an I-term relax trigger on throttle movement for the pitch I term just like the one applied to sportmode control surfaces 
but make the trigger watch only for increases in throttle and only in the lower half of the throttle stick. This should keep i term active in a harrier when throttle is being pumped in the upper 
range of the stick, maintain I term trim when cutting throttle, and isolate the ballooning event that occurs from a sudden jump from very low to very high airspeed.  This little hack only belongs on 
levelmode.  It is not an issue in sportmode.  Failsafe behavior also tested today - Everything working as intended.  Failsafe when disarmed returns servos to neutral position.  Failsafe when armed 
and in the air puts the plane in levelmode and it floats down out of the air in a perfectly level orientation and was even easily catchable during tests.  Return of control signal in the air 
is also possible without incident.  My transmitter requires throttle to be @ 0% in order to link up - so i was not able to verify if the firmware in the plane is also going to require throttle to be 
dropped below the throttle safety cutoff in order to regain control.  This relic of drone firmware might need some adaptation for fixed wing.  I don't mind that throttle needs to be dropped below 
safety cutoff to reactivate throttle in the event of signal loss and return - but control surfaces should immediately respond upon return of signal.  Maybe I will hold levelmode active (but with surface control) 
while waiting on the throttle safety to be satisfied and then restore aux selected flight mode with return of throttle.  Final note from failsafe testing is that currently levelmode is running with an unlocked
(no I term) yaw axis.  Intention is to change this in the future for the sportmode heading hold logic, but for now - during failsafe the plane is only going to track as true as the rudder trim as it
floats down.  Stuntmaster is always out of trim (sort of the reason i got into making a firmware) and it has been flying so true in sport mode that I have already forgotten how poorly this plane
tracks.  Its no surprise that it slowly drifted off its line on the rudder... but this can be fixed as levelmode yaw logic is improved.  A brief flight was performed in manual mode - and it felt exactly 
like flying the plane on a standard receiver - which is absolutely terrible.  Stuntmaster is a sloppy sloppy plane that never flies straight and can never be put in perfect trim.  I dont miss it flying 
like this.  It makes me feel like a terrible pilot and it isnt enjoyable to watch it in the air either.  No changes have been made to sportmode - but some agressive hucking about before the packs were
drained confirms that sportmode is still functioning as intended.  Sportmode makes the plane feel like an expensive high qualitty model instead of sloppy foam garbage and I get to feel like a better pilot
and spend time practicing new 3D moves instead of just practicing trying to keep it going straight.

thoughts after today's session
- levelmode feels close enough to let the kids fly it



code todo list:
- rework pid.c - this is becoming an absolute mess and needs organization especially with regard to how different combos of pid calculations and i term behavior are required for different flight modes
- levelmode pid attenuation (maybe on roll axis only?)
-	launch mode in levelmode with pitch up till sticks are engaged
- launch mode with throttle delay for pushers
- better i term relax trigger and stick boost that isnt influenced be acro rates selections
- throttle triggered pitch I term relax
- YAW heading hold in levelmode (relaxed by yaw, or roll + pitch deflections)
- failsafe throttle safety behavior to allow control surface movement immediately upon signal return


testing todo list:
-evaluate 1st vs 2nd order D term filters and eliminate one of them if unneeded
-levelmode pid attenuation on roll - need to decide if I like higher roll gains in sport mode
-test torque boost
-crank up stick boost again
-lower default acro rates and see how this impacts i term relax trigger and stick boost
-SOLVED - figure out why there is so little elevator authority when banked on roll in levelmode
-increase levelmode strength for a slightly more connected and less squishy feel - evaluate for comfort with proximity to obstacles
